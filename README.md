Neural Network From Scratch
This project demonstrates how to build a simple neural network from scratch using Python. The notebook walks through the entire process, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
You can install the necessary packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Running the Notebook
To run the notebook, you need to have Jupyter installed. If you don't have Jupyter installed, you can install it using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install jupyter
Once Jupyter is installed, you can start the notebook server:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Then, open the Neural Network From Scratch.ipynb file in your browser.

Contents
The notebook includes the following sections:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: This section covers loading the dataset and preprocessing it for training.
Neural Network Implementation: This section walks through implementing a neural network from scratch, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight updates.
Training the Model: This section demonstrates how to train the neural network using the training data.
Evaluating the Model: This section shows how to evaluate the model's performance using accuracy metrics.
Results
The model is trained and evaluated on a sample dataset. The final accuracy of the model is displayed at the end of the notebook.
